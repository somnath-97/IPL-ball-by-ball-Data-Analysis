- Step 2 :List unique batting teams present in the dataset.
- Step 3 :Find the total number of wickets recorded.
- Step 4 :Display details of deliveries with extras runs greater than 1.
- Step 5 :Retrieve overs and ball numbers for deliveries where a wicket was taken.
#### Intermediate Level:


- Step 1 : Calculate the total runs scored by each batting team.
- Step 2 : List the top bowlers with the most wickets.
- Step 3 : Find the average number of runs scored per over for each batting team.
